# 8Club App

This Flutter app allows users to select and deselect the hotspots and record audio and type text simultaneously. The app features a custom recording interface with a dynamic wave visualization that appears during and after recording. The text input adjusts in size based on the keyboard's visibility.

## Features

- **Select and Deselect**: User can select and deselect multiple hubspots.
- **Audio Recording**: Start and stop audio recording with a single button.
- **Waveform Visualization**: A real-time audio waveform visualizes the recording in progress and after completion.
- **Dynamic Text Field**: The text field adapts its size when the keyboard is opened or closed, offering an optimized user experience.
- **File Storage**: Recorded audio files are saved locally with unique filenames in `.wav` format.
- **Permission Handling**: Microphone permissions are requested before recording starts.
